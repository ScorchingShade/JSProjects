# JSProjects
A basic Ecomm fullstack app


To run the application, first go to backend folder as

``` 
cd backend
```

Then run :
```
npm start
```

Finally go back to the frontend folder as:
```
cd ../frontend/
```

Then again run :
```
npm start
```

If backend is not running on port 3000, change the package.json in frontend to the correct proxy:

```
  "proxy": "http://localhost:<PORT>",
```
